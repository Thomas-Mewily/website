Hello I'm Thomas (alias Mewily), a French guy that enjoy doing these things when I have free time :

- Programming : 
    - Small Interpreters, Programming Langages, 
    - Game engines, Videos Game
- Doing some Pixel Art
- Playing some video game with friends
...

I'm currently enjoy programming in Rust ü¶Ä, but I also like to program in C, C++, C#, Java, Python...

I have some years of experience on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/-tstd-/), mainly programming game üê±

I try to make this quick website over a week-end, I'm currently using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Tailwind theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-tailwind/) for generating it. It is hosted on a github page for now. Web technology isn't my cup of tea, but it's been years since I wanted to have a personnal web site for sharing some idea, the content matter more.
