The game was on the playstore a few years ago (2019 - 2023/2024), but due to lack of update to change the apk version it was removed (*as well as my Android developper licence that cost me 20 â‚¬ because I didn't have any other app published*).

It can still be played by downloading and installing it's apk https://apkpure.com/fr/conkestator/com.Conkestator.Conkestator .
